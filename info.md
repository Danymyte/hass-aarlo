# Asynchronous Arlo Component for Home Assistant.

An (almost) drop in replacement for the standard [Arlo](https://my.arlo.com/#/cameras) package.

## Notes
Versions starting 0.0.7 are test builds!

## Features
It provides:
* Acces to cameras, base stations, sirens and doorbells.
* Asynchronous, almost immediate, notification of motion and sound events.
* Ability to view library recordings, take snapshots and direct stream from cameras.
* Tracking of environmental stats from certain base station types.
* Enhanced state notifications.
* A custom [glance card](https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo) to get at all this stuff.
