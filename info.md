# Asynchronous Arlo Component for Home Assistant.

An (almost) drop in replacement for the standard [Arlo](https://my.arlo.com/#/cameras) package.

### Version 0.6

Welcome to a new version!

Please see [here](https://github.com/twrecked/hass-aarlo/blob/master/README.md) for more details but remember - **DON'T PANIC!** - I'll be keeping the `0.5` stream will be around for a little longer so if all else fails, log a bug report and revert to that version.

## Features
It provides:
* Acces to cameras, base stations, sirens and doorbells, lights.
* Asynchronous, almost immediate, notification of motion and sound events.
* Ability to view library recordings, take snapshots and direct stream from cameras.
* Tracking of environmental stats from certain base station types.
* Special switches to trip alarms and take snapshots from cameras.
* Enhanced state notifications.
* A custom [glance card](https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo) to get at all this stuff.
